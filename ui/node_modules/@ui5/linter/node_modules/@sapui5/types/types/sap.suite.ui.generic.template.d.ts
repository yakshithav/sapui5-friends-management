     * for all these pages needs to be collected in one controller extension, which results in code that is
     * difficult to maintain.
     *  `registerControllerExtensions` provides a tool to distribute the extension code according to pages they
     * are actually used on.
     *  To use this tool, you should create separate classes implementing the logic for each single page.

     *
     * (Original purpose: When (standard) filters (i.e. filters defined in annotations) are provided with default
     * values (also from the annotation), and the user actively removed the default without giving a new value,
     * and later tried to restore from that state, the default values were reappearing. This was caused by the
     * way the old API of SFB (getDataSuiteFormat and setDataSuiteFormat) worked: the get method returned only
     * select options for the filters that actually had values (i.e. no select option for the filters the user
     * removed the values from), and the set method only overrode those values, select options were provided
     * for (i.e. the missing ones just kept their default value set during initialization). To overcome this
     * problem, the extension was created to inform Fiori elements about all fields potentially running into
     * that problem, and we added a select option (I EQ "") for those fields. This workaround of course ahs
     * two severe problems: A filter with eq "" is not the same as not having a filter for the same field (rather
     * the opposite), and all applications were required to keep extension and annotations in sync (and missing
     * to do that would only be found in very exceptional cases). With the newer API of SFB (getUiState and
     * setUiState), this problem has been overcome (esp. as setUiState overrides all filters, not only the ones
     * provided).)
