# Testing

The ESLint custom plug-in is an extension of existing [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins) open-source node plugin. This plug-in contains custom rules and their respective tests. ESLint provides the [RuleTester](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins#testing) utility to make it easy to test the rules of your plugin.<br/>
[eslint.RuleTester](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/nodejs-api#ruletester) is a utility to write tests for ESLint rules. It is used internally for the bundled rules that come with ESLint, and it can also be used by plugins. [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is used as test framework. Mocha provides a skeleton code for unit tests. Finally the tests are run through npm.<br/>
Below you could find the steps to test the rules.

## Steps to test
* Go to your project directory and open terminal. 
* Run following command to run the tests.
    ```
    npm run test
    ```
  This will eventually call the *test* script frpm *package.json* and run your tests.
* Finally you can see the test results in your terminal. All 464 test-cases should pass.
